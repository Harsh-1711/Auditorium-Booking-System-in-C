The name of the project is “Auditorium Booking System”. The Auditorium Booking System is a software application that enables users to book auditoriums for various events. The system typically includes a text-based interface where users can make a booking request, view approved bookings, and search for their booking details and status. Auditorium booking systems are commonly used by educational institutions, event organizers, and businesses that need to schedule and manage events in large venues. These systems can help automate the booking process, reduce double bookings (easy booking), and simplify the management of events. An auditorium booking system can provide a time-saving solution for scheduling and managing events in a large venue while improving the user experience for both administrators and customers
